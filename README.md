# Time Series

To begin, let's look at some time series data plots.

The ** syntax is used to pass keywords and values in dictionary form to a function. For more on * and ** (*args and **kwargs), see this page.

# Time Series vs. Linear

For linear regression, we attempted to explain the variance of a continuous target variable via a set of **independent predictor features**. We assumed that there was no **autocorrelation** amongst our records.  In other words, we did not use the target variable of one row to predict that of another.

In time series models, we make the opposite assumption.  We assume that a given value can best be predicted by its **past values**.

We replace our features with past values of our target. 

The models we will cover in lecture include endogenous variables.
<em>Endogenous</em> means caused by factors within the system. 

<em>Exogenous</em>, caused by factors outside the system. 

Many statsmodels tools use <tt>endog</tt> to represent the incoming time series data in place of the constant <tt>y</tt>.<br>

# Datetime objects

Datetime objects make our time series modeling lives easier.  They will allow us to perform essential data prep tasks with a few lines of code.  

We need our timeseries **index** to be datetime objects, since our models will rely on being able to identify the previous chronological value.

There is a datetime [library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html), and inside pandas there is a datetime module as well as a to_datetime() function.


Let's import some data on **gun violence in Chicago**.

[source](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Gun-Crimes-Heat-Map/iinq-m3rg)

Let's look at some summary stats:

The data extracts the year of offense as its own columns.

While this does show some interesting information that will be relevant to our time series analysis, we are going to get more granular.

# Date Time Objects

For time series modeling, the first step is to make sure that the index is a date time object.

There are a few ways to **reindex** our series to datetime. 

We can use the pd.to_datetime() method

Or, we can parse the dates directly on import

We've covered some of the fun abilities of datetime objects, including being able to extract components of the date like so:

We can easily see now see whether offenses happen, for example, during business hours.

We also have new abilities, such as **resampling**

To create our timeseries, we will count the number of gun offenses reported per day.

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the differnece resampling aliases

When resampling, we have to provide a rule to resample by, and an **aggregate function**.

**To upsample** is to increase the frequency of the data of interest.  
**To downsample** is to decrease the frequency of the data of interest.

For our purposes, we will downsample, and  count the number of occurences per day.

Our time series will consist of a series of counts of gun reports per day.

Let's visualize our timeseries with a plot.

There seems to be some abnormal activity happening towards the end of our series.

**[sun-times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/6/8/21281998/chicago-deadliest-day-violence-murder-history-police-crime)**

Let's treat the span of days from 5-31 to 6-03 as outliers. 

There are several ways to do this, but let's first remove the outliers, and populate an an empty array with the original date range.  That will introduce us to the pd.date_range method.

Now let's sp

Let's zoom in on that week again

The datetime object allows us several options of how to fill those gaps:

Let's proceed with the interpolated data

Let's begin considering some models for our data.

These are not useful for prediction just yet, but they will lead us towards our prediction models.

Now that we've cleaned up a few data points, let's downsample to the week level.  

# Visual Diagnostics with SMA and EWMA

# Simple Moving Average

A simple moving average consists of an average across a specified window of time. 

The datetime index allows us to calculate simple moving averages via the rolling function.

The rolling function calculates a statistic across a moving **window**, which we can change with the window paraamter.

Let's calculate a month long moving average

This is simply the avarage of a datapoint and the previous three data points:

As we can see from the plot below, simple moving average **smooths** out the series. Smoothing can help visualize the underlying pattern.  It can also be a very simple predictive model, where we just project the mean out into the future.

The simple moving avereage tracks fairly well, but does not reach to the peaks and valleys of the original distribution.

If we plot the moving average across 52 weeeks, we can see a smooth trend across a year.  The SMA reaches back 52 weeks, shwing that the steepest growth of gun crime started around the beginning of 2016 and leveled out at the beginning of 2017.

# EWMA
## Exponentially Weighted Moving Average 

An alternative to SMA is the EWMA. The exponentially weighted average gives more weight to the points closer to the date in question.  With EWMA, the average will track more closely to the peaks and valleys. If there are extreme historical values in the dataset, the EWMA will be less skewed than the SMA.


$\large d^3 * X_{t-3} + d^2 * X_{t-2} + d^1 * X_{t-1}+ (1-d)*X_t$

The higher the $\alpha$ parameter, the closer the EWMA will be to the actual value of the point.

Let's plot our rolling statistics with some different windows

Again, if we zoom in to the year level, we can see peaks and valleys according to the seasons.  

We can also plot rolling averages for the variance and standard deviation.

If we zoom in on our standard deviation, we can the variance of our data has quite a fluctuation at different moments in time.  When we are building our models, we will want to remove this variability, or our models will have different performance at different times.  We will be unable, then to be confident our model will perform well at an arbitrary point in the future.


### Components of Time Series Data
A time series in general is supposed to be affected by four main components, which can be separated from the observed data. These components are: *Trend, Cyclical, Seasonal and Irregular* components.

- **Trend** : The long term movement of a time series. For example, series relating to population growth, number of houses in a city etc. show upward trend.
- **Seasonality** : Fluctuation in the data set that follow a regular pattern due to outside influences. For example sales of ice-cream increase in summer, or daily web traffic.
- **Cyclical** : When data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period.  Think of business cycles which usually last several years, but where the length of the current cycle is unknown beforehand.
- **Irregular**: Are caused by unpredictable influences, which are not regular and also do not repeat in a particular pattern. These variations are caused by incidences such as war, strike, earthquake, flood, revolution, etc. There is no defined statistical technique for measuring random fluctuations in a time series.


*Note: Many people confuse cyclic behaviour with seasonal behaviour, but they are really quite different. If the fluctuations are not of fixed period then they are cyclic; if the period is unchanging and associated with some aspect of the calendar, then the pattern is seasonal.*

The statsmodels seasonal decompose can also help show us the trends in our data.

### Statistical stationarity: 

When building our models, we will want to account for these trends somehow.  Time series whose mean and variance have trends across time will be difficult to predict out into the future. 

A **stationary time series** is one whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation, etc. are all constant over time. Most statistical forecasting methods are based on the assumption that the time series can be rendered approximately stationary (i.e., "stationarized") through the use of mathematical transformations. A stationarized series is relatively easy to predict: you simply predict that its statistical properties will be the same in the future as they have been in the past!

While we can get a sense of how stationary our data is with visuals, the Dickey Fuller test gives us a quantitatitive measure.

Here the null hypothesis is that the TS is non-stationary. If the ‘Test Statistic’ is less than the ‘Critical Value’, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that the series is stationary.

As we concluded visually, our original timeseries does not pass the test of stationarity.

### How to stationarize time series data

A series of steps can be taken to stationarize your data - also known -  as removing trends (linear trends, seasonaility/periodicity, etc - more details on transformations <a href='http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/whatuse.htm'>here</a>).


One way to remove trends is to difference our data.  
Differencing is performed by subtracting the previous observation (lag=1) from the current observation.

Sometimes, we have to difference the differenced data (known as a second difference) to achieve stationary data. <b>The number of times we have to difference our data is the order of differencing</b> - we will use this information when building our model.

Let's difference our data and see if it improves Dickey-Fuller Test

One we have achieved stationarity the next step in fitting a model to address any autocorrelation that remains in the differenced series.
